Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

  The artifact I created for CS-370 is a project where I built and trained a pirate intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The agent utilizes neural networks from Keras and reinforcement learning techniques to navigate a maze and find treasure before the human player. I implemented a Q-learning algorithm with experience replay, allowing the pirate agent to make decisions based on past experiences and continuously improve its performance.
I developed this artifact as part of the CS-370 course (Artificial Intelligence) in 2024 to showcase my understanding of AI concepts such as reinforcement learning, neural networks, and intelligent agent development.


Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
  
  I selected this CS-370 artifact for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to apply artificial intelligence concepts and develop intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. This project highlights my skills in reinforcement learning, neural networks, and algorithmic decision-making, critical components of modern software development.
Key components of this artifact that showcase my skills include the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm with experience replay and using neural networks. These aspects demonstrate my proficiency in developing machine-learning models and integrating them into interactive applications. Additionally, the project required me to write modular, maintainable code that reflects best practices in software engineering.
To improve the artifact, I focused on enhancing the performance and efficiency of the pirate agent's learning process. I refined the experience replay mechanism to prioritize more significant experiences, allowing the agent to learn faster and make better decisions. I also improved the code structure, making it more modular and easier to maintain, and added more comprehensive documentation to support collaboration and future development.


Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, I met the course outcomes I initially planned to achieve with this enhancement. In Module One, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to apply advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as reinforcement learning and neural networks, and improve the code for modularity and efficiency. Through the enhancements to the pirate intelligent agent, I showcased these skills by implementing a more efficient Q-learning algorithm, refining the agent's decision-making capabilities, and ensuring that the code was well-organized and maintainable. This directly aligns with the course outcomes related to designing and implementing intelligent systems.
At this point, I don't have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans. The enhancements I made effectively covered the outcomes I set out to achieve, such as improving the projectâ€™s AI components and code structure, so my focus moving forward will be on maintaining that alignment with course outcomes while further honing these skills.


Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

  Enhancing and modifying the CS-370 artifact was an insightful process that deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence and software development. As I worked on improving the pirate intelligent agent, I learned how to apply advanced reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning and experience replay more effectively. I also gained a stronger grasp of using neural networks within AI agents to optimize decision-making and task performance.
One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of balancing performance optimization with code maintainability. While the agent must learn efficiently, having clear, modular code is equally important for long-term usability and collaboration. Improving the code structure was a great exercise in making AI models both powerful and scalable.
The most significant challenge I faced was fine-tuning the experience replay mechanism to prioritize important experiences without over-complicating the learning process. Striking the right balance between complexity and performance required multiple iterations and debugging. Another challenge was ensuring that the code enhancements maintained the original functionality while introducing new improvements. Testing and refining the learning algorithms were critical steps in overcoming these obstacles.

Course outcomes that have been met so far: 
Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.  
Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
